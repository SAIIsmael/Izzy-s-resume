## Clone or Download
You can use this template in two ways:

### 1. **Clone it on Overleaf**
For the easiest experience, you can clone this template directly on Overleaf:
[Click here to clone the project on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/tqcrxgrvdwyr#2e019f
)

### 2. **Download the Source Code**
Alternatively, you can clone the source code from this repository and compile it locally using a LaTeX editor of your choice (e.g., TeXShop, TeXworks, or command-line LaTeX).

## How to Use the Template

### Step 1: Set Up Your LaTeX Environment

#### **For Overleaf:**
Simply clone the project and start editing. Overleaf takes care of all dependencies automatically, so you donâ€™t need to worry about installing packages.

#### **For Local Compilation:**

If you're using a local LaTeX editor, you'll need to ensure that you have the necessary packages installed. This template relies on the following packages:
- `latexsym`
- `fullpage`
- `titlesec`
- `marvosym`
- `color` (with `usenames,dvipsnames`)
- `verbatim`
- `enumitem`
- `hyperref` (with `hidelinks`)
- `fancyhdr`
- `babel` (English)
- `tabularx`
- `fontawesome5`
- `academicons`
- `sourcecodepro` (Source Code Pro font)

If you're using a package manager for your LaTeX distribution (e.g., MiKTeX or TeX Live), these packages should be available by default. If not, you can manually install them.

### Step 2: Edit Your Resume
1. Open the `main.tex` file in your LaTeX editor.
2. Customize the fields as needed:
   - Replace your name, contact information, and summary in the header.
   - Modify the experience, skills, and education sections with your details.
   - The template is designed with easy-to-understand commands like `\resumeItem`, `\resumeSubheading`, and `\resumeItemListStart`, so you can easily update the content.

### Step 3: Compile Your Document
Once youâ€™ve made your changes, compile the document using your LaTeX editor. Overleaf automatically compiles your document for you, while in a local setup, use the command:

```bash
pdflatex main.tex
```
If you are using fonts like Source Code Pro or icons like FontAwesome5 or Academicons, ensure you have them installed or modify the template to use alternative fonts/icons.

### Step 4: Export the PDF
Once compiled, you will have a PDF file of your resume ready to be printed or shared online.
